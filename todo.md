## Notes

- Projects data lives in `PROJECTS_JSON` environment variable (set in Vercel dashboard for production)
- Email delivery via Resend API (`RESEND_API_KEY` env var)
- Dark-mode only — no light mode toggle (brand decision: premium dark aesthetic)
- All sections are single-page (SPA scroll) — no separate routes except `/api/*`
- Keep `babafemi.codes` as the handle/brand throughout
